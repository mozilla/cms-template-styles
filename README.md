## File Naming Conventions

- All files should be named in `hyphenated-lowercase`

## Foxlight

Foxlight is a core dependency of these templates and is intended to be developed in tandem with them. When many templates use a common component, it's recommended that it be pushed upstream to Foxlight for wider usage.

If you want to co-develop Foxlight locally and see changes reflected in this project, you can run `npm link` in the root of your Foxlight repo and then `npm link foxlight` in this repo. Once you've done this you should `npm start` Foxlight and then you'll see your edits immediately reflected in the front end here.

You can also import Foxlight code, such as color variables, a la carte into your templates here since it's a dependency. For an example see `src/templates/3-boxes/style.scss`.
